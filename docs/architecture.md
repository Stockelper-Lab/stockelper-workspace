**Scale & Complexity:**

- **Primary domain:** Full-stack AI-powered fintech platform (web + backend services + data pipelines + ML/AI)
- **Complexity level:** High
  - Brownfield extension of existing 5-microservice system → expanding to 6 microservices
  - AI/ML with multi-agent LangGraph system (gpt-5.1 models)
  - Graph database (Neo4j) with temporal pattern matching
  - Real-time event detection and alerting via Supabase Realtime
  - Multi-database coordination (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j)
  - Fintech compliance requirements
- **Estimated architectural components:**
  - 3 major new subsystems (Event Extraction Engine, Prediction Engine, Alert System)
  - 5 existing services to extend (Frontend, Airflow, LLM, KG Builder, News Crawler)
  - 2 new services (Backtesting Service, Portfolio Service - containerized)
  - Supabase Realtime for real-time notifications (no custom notification service needed)
  - 10+ integration points across services
  - 3 database systems requiring coordination

### Deployment / Build Assumptions (Updated 2025-12-30)

The production build and runtime assumptions are updated based on recent meeting decisions:

- **LLM Chat Service**
  - **Container**: `stockelper-llm-server`
  - **Runtime**: AWS EC2 (cloud)
  - **Build/Run source of truth**: `stockelper-llm/cloud.docker-compose.yml`
- **Backtesting Service**
  - **Container**: `stockelper-backtesting-server`
  - **Runtime**: Local (initial phase)
  - **Repository split plan**: `.../Stockelper-Lab/stockelper-backtesting/` (separate repo)
- **Portfolio Service**
  - **Container**: `stockelper-portfolio-server`
  - **Runtime**: Local (initial phase)
  - **Repository split plan**: `.../Stockelper-Lab/stockelper-portfolio/` (separate repo)
- **Result persistence**
  - Backtesting/Portfolio results are stored in a **remote PostgreSQL** used by the frontend.
  - **Host**: `${POSTGRES_HOST}` (injected via environment variable)
  - **Port**: `${POSTGRES_PORT}` (default: 5432)
  - **User**: `${POSTGRES_USER}` (injected via environment variable)
  - **Password**: `${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}` (injected via environment variable)
  - **Schema name**: `"stockelper-fe"` (note: hyphen requires quoting in PostgreSQL identifiers)
  - **Credentials must NOT be hard-coded in repositories**. Use environment variables / secret manager.
- **De-scoped local containers (do not use)**
  - `stockelper-postgres`
  - `stockelper-redis`
  - `stockelper-backtest-worker`

### Technical Constraints & Dependencies

**Existing Infrastructure (Must Integrate With):**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15.3 with React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Prisma ORM, JWT authentication
- **Data Pipeline:** Apache Airflow 2.10 orchestration already established
- **LLM Service:** FastAPI + LangGraph multi-agent system operational
- **Knowledge Graph:** Neo4j 5.11+ with existing entity relationships
- **News Crawler:** Python-based scraper for Naver Finance
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL (users/auth), MongoDB (raw news), Neo4j (knowledge graph)

**External Dependencies:**
- **DART API:** Financial disclosure data (official Korean source)
- **KIS OpenAPI:** Korean trading data and real-time market information
- **Naver Finance:** News article source for event extraction
- **OpenAI API:** LLM inference for chat interface and event classification (gpt-5.1)
- **Supabase Realtime:** Real-time database change notifications for frontend updates

**Korean Market Constraints:**
- Korean language processing for event extraction
- Korean financial regulations (informational platform positioning)
- PIPA compliance (Personal Information Protection Act)
- Business hours aligned with Korean market trading times

**MVP Scope Boundaries:**
- Events limited to defined ontology (not all-encompassing)
- Portfolio recommendations scheduled daily at 9:00 AM (functionality exists, adding scheduling)
- Backtesting user-initiated (not automatic in MVP)
- Single market focus (Korean only)
- **MVP Pilot Scope:** Focus on AI-related sector stocks initially
  - Big Tech: Naver, Kakao
  - AI Software/Platform: 이스트소프트, 와이즈넛, 코난테크놀로지, 마음AI, 엑셈
  - AI Data/Language: 플리토
  - Vision/Security: 알체라, 한국전자인증
  - Robotics/Autonomous: 레인보우로보틱스, 유진로봇, 로보로보, 큐렉소
  - Rationale: Focused dataset for faster validation, expandable to all sectors post-MVP

### Cross-Cutting Concerns Identified

**1. Event Extraction Accuracy (Foundation)**
- Quality of event extraction directly impacts all prediction accuracy
- Requires ontology management interface for continuous improvement
- Validation workflow with human review samples
- Accuracy metrics per category tracked in observability system

**2. Multi-Database Consistency**
- Three databases must remain synchronized: PostgreSQL (users), MongoDB (news), Neo4j (events/relationships)
- Transaction boundaries across database types
- Data pipeline orchestration through Airflow DAG
- Rollback strategies when updates fail

**3. Real-Time Orchestration**
- Event alerts must trigger within 5 minutes of detection
- Real-time similarity matching against knowledge graph
- Push notification delivery system
- Background monitoring without impacting user-facing performance

**4. Prediction Confidence & Transparency**
- Confidence levels calculated from pattern strength (historical instances)
- Clear explanation of "similar events under similar conditions"
- Historical examples shown to users
- Disclaimers embedded in all outputs (informational, not advice)

**5. Security & Privacy**
- User portfolio data isolation (cannot access other users' holdings)
- Investment profile privacy
- Prediction history per-user
- Audit logs without exposing personal data in aggregate analytics

**6. Observability & Debugging**
- Prediction logging: timestamp, user, stock, confidence, historical patterns used
- Event extraction quality metrics
- System performance tracking (response times, error rates)
- Airflow DAG monitoring for pipeline health

**7. Korean Fintech Compliance**
- Embedded disclaimers: "educational purposes only, not investment advice"
- 12-month audit trail retention
- PIPA data rights (access, correction, deletion, portability)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

#### Daily Stock Price Data Collection (Decision 3d - Added 2026-01-03)

**Purpose:** Provide historical price data for backtesting and portfolio recommendation engines.

**Data Source:**
- KIS OpenAPI or similar Korean stock market data provider
- Universe: AI-sector stocks (same template as DART collection)

**Collection Schedule:**
- Daily execution after market close
- Collect OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data
- Target: All stocks in `modules/dart_disclosure/universe.ai-sector.template.json`

**Data Schema (Local PostgreSQL):**
```sql
CREATE TABLE daily_stock_prices (
    stock_code VARCHAR(6) NOT NULL,
    trade_date DATE NOT NULL,
    open_price DECIMAL(12,2),
    high_price DECIMAL(12,2),
    low_price DECIMAL(12,2),
    close_price DECIMAL(12,2),
    volume BIGINT,
    market_cap DECIMAL(20,2),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (stock_code, trade_date)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_stock_date ON daily_stock_prices(stock_code, trade_date DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_trade_date ON daily_stock_prices(trade_date DESC);
```

**Airflow DAG Specification:**
```python
# dags/daily_price_collection_dag.py
DAG_ID = 'dag_daily_price_collection'
SCHEDULE = '0 16 * * 1-5'  # 4:00 PM KST, weekdays only
OWNER = '영상'

Tasks:
1. load_universe_template
   - Read modules/dart_disclosure/universe.ai-sector.template.json
   - Extract stock codes

2. collect_daily_prices (parallelized per stock)
   - For each stock: Fetch OHLCV from KIS API
   - Rate limiting: Max 5 requests/sec

3. store_to_local_postgresql
   - Bulk insert to daily_stock_prices table
   - Handle duplicates (ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE)

4. validation_and_alert
   - Check for missing stocks
   - Alert if data collection failed
```

**Storage:**
- **Location:** Local PostgreSQL (NOT remote)
- **Purpose:** Backtesting engine reads price history from this table
- **Retention:** Keep all historical data (no cleanup policy)

**Implementation Gap:**
- ❌ Not Implemented: Price collection module
- ❌ Not Implemented: Airflow DAG
- ❌ Not Implemented: Local PostgreSQL schema
- 📋 Action Item: 영상님 - Implement daily price collection pipeline

**Reference:** See `meeting-analysis-2026-01-03.md` Section 4 for requirements.

---

**Pipeline 2: News-Based Events**
- **Frequency:** Every 2-3 hours per specific stock
- **Sources:** Naver Securities News + Toss Securities News
- **Workflow:**
  1. Periodic crawling for specific stocks
  2. **Deduplication:** Apply effective deduplication strategy (must be designed)
  3. Event extraction from deduplicated news articles
  4. Add events to Neo4j knowledge graph
  5. Pattern matching and user notification (same as Pipeline 1)

**Deduplication Strategy (To Be Designed):**
- News articles from multiple sources must be deduplicated before event extraction
- Strategy must account for:
  - Same news from different sources (Naver vs Toss)
  - Similar news with slight variations
  - Timestamp-based duplicate detection
  - Content similarity scoring
- Effective deduplication critical for knowledge graph quality

### Architectural Extension Strategy

**Core Principle: Extend, Don't Replace**

All new functionality integrates into existing services following established patterns:

**1. Portfolio Recommendations (Extension):**
- **Existing Capability:** Recommendation generation already implemented in LLM service
- **New Requirement:** Daily scheduling at 9:00 AM using previous day's closing prices
- **Implementation Approach:** Add Airflow DAG for scheduled execution (9:00 AM trigger)
- **Pattern to Follow:** Existing Airflow DAG style and conventions
- **Note:** Core recommendation logic exists; only scheduling integration needed

**2. Event-Driven Backtesting (User-Initiated):**
- **Trigger:** Explicit user requests only (not automatic)
- **User Experience:** Progress notifications for time-consuming operations
- **Implementation Approach:** Async processing with status updates
- **Pattern to Follow:** Existing async task patterns in LLM service
- **Notification:** Separate notification to inform user of progress or completion

**3. Event Notifications (New Feature):**
- **Requirement:** Real-time alerts when similar events occur
- **Trigger:** New disclosure event or news event matches historical patterns
- **Implementation Approach:** Leverage existing notification patterns
- **Integration:** Event monitoring system triggers notifications after pattern matching
- **Pattern to Follow:** Existing push notification infrastructure (if available) or establish pattern consistent with current architecture

**4. Airflow DAG Extensions:**
- **Guideline:** New DAGs must follow existing style and conventions
- **New DAGs Required:**
  - Daily DART disclosure check (once per day)
  - Periodic news crawling (every 2-3 hours per stock)
  - Portfolio recommendation scheduling (9:00 AM daily)
  - Event pattern matching and notification triggers
- **Requirement:** Review existing DAG structure before implementing new pipelines

**5. API Structure Adherence:**
- **Principle:** Reuse and adhere to existing API patterns
- **Frontend ↔ LLM Service:** Maintain consistent endpoint structure
- **Authentication:** JWT pattern already established
- **Error Handling:** Follow existing error response formats
- **New Endpoints:** Event queries, backtesting requests, recommendation retrieval

**6. Database Schema Evolution:**
- **PostgreSQL:** Reuse existing schemas for user data, add alert preferences
- **MongoDB:** Reuse existing schemas for news/financial data
- **Neo4j:**
  - Reuse existing entity and relationship schemas where possible
  - **New schemas required:**
    - Date-indexed events (for temporal pattern matching)
    - Subgraph pattern structures
    - Event metadata (source, disclosure vs news, deduplication markers)
    - Historical price movements linked to events
  - Ensure backward compatibility with existing graph queries

### Architectural Decisions Inherited from Existing Stack

- Airflow DAGs for new orchestration needs (4 new DAGs identified)
- Frontend components following Radix UI + Tailwind patterns
- LLM service endpoints for new prediction capabilities

### Integration Points for New Features

**Event Extraction Engine (Dual Pipeline):**

**Pipeline 1 - Disclosure Events:**
- Input: DART API (daily check)
- Processing: Event extraction → Deduplication (if needed)
- Output: Neo4j knowledge graph (disclosure event schema)

**Pipeline 2 - News Events:**
- Input: News Crawler → Naver Securities News + Toss Securities News (every 2-3 hours)
- Processing: Deduplication (critical) → Event extraction
- Output: Neo4j knowledge graph (news event schema)

**Pattern Matching & Notification:**
- Input: New event in knowledge graph (from either pipeline)
- Processing: Compare with historical events → Measure stock price movement
- Output: User notification if pattern match found

**Prediction Engine:**
- Input: Neo4j knowledge graph queries (historical event patterns)
- Processing: LangGraph agents in LLM service (extend existing multi-agent system, refactored to LangChain v1.0+)
- Output: REST API endpoints for frontend consumption

**Alert System:**
- Monitoring: Triggered by event pipeline completion (Airflow DAG tasks)
- Storage: PostgreSQL for user alert preferences
- Delivery: Leverage existing notification patterns + push notifications

**Chat Interface:**
- Frontend: Extend existing Next.js pages/components
- Backend: LLM service API routes (FastAPI endpoints)
- Real-time: Consider existing WebSocket patterns or add if needed

**Scheduled Portfolio Recommendations:**
- Trigger: Airflow DAG scheduled at 9:00 AM daily
- Input: Previous day's closing prices + user portfolio holdings
- Processing: Existing recommendation logic (already implemented)
- Output: Precomputed recommendations delivered to users at 9:00 AM

### Critical Technical Updates Required

**1. LangChain v1.0+ Compliance - ✅ VERIFIED (2025-12-29):**
- ✅ Existing LangChain/LangGraph code already uses v1.0+ compliant patterns
- ✅ Agents use StateGraph directly (advanced pattern, more flexible than helper functions)
- ✅ Dependencies include `langchain>=1.0.0` and `langchain-classic>=1.0.0`
- ✅ No migration required - codebase already production-ready
- **Update:** Focus shifted to model upgrades (gpt-5.1 → gpt-5.1) and validation testing

**2. News Deduplication Strategy:**
- Design effective deduplication before event extraction
- Consider content similarity algorithms (TF-IDF, embeddings, fuzzy matching)
- Implement deduplication markers in MongoDB storage
- Track deduplication effectiveness metrics

**3. Dual Event Pipeline Coordination:**
- Separate Airflow DAGs for disclosure vs news events
- Unified event schema in Neo4j (with source metadata)
- Consistent pattern matching logic across both pipelines
- Handle different update frequencies (daily vs 2-3 hours)

### No Starter Template Initialization Required

**Rationale:**
This is a brownfield project with established technical decisions. The architecture document will guide AI agents to extend existing services following current patterns, not initialize a new project from scratch.

**First Implementation Story:**
Rather than "Initialize project from starter template," the first story will be "Review existing codebase structure and LangChain v1.0+ migration requirements" to ensure AI agents understand the existing architecture and necessary refactoring before making changes.

## Core Architectural Decisions

### Decision Priority Analysis

**Critical Decisions (Block Implementation):**
1. Neo4j event schema structure (extends existing ontology)
2. Dual-pipeline data collection frequencies
3. Event pattern matching algorithm (subgraph-based)
4. News deduplication strategy (hybrid embeddings)
5. Airflow DAG structure (7 separate DAGs)
6. REST API endpoint design

**Important Decisions (Shape Architecture):**
1. Notification delivery mechanism (badge pattern with polling)
2. LangChain v1.0+ migration approach
3. Database schema extensions (Neo4j, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

**Deferred Decisions (Post-MVP):**
1. WebSocket/Push notification upgrades
2. Advanced similarity scoring (multi-dimensional)
3. Real-time event streaming architecture
4. Cross-market event correlation

### Data Architecture

#### Neo4j Event Schema (Decision 1)

**Choice:** Unified Event Node with Source Property

**Schema Structure:**
```cypher
// News articles (source documents)
(:News {
  news_id: string,
  title: string,
  content: text,
  source: enum('NAVER_SECURITIES', 'TOSS_SECURITIES'),
  published_date: datetime,
  url: string,
  dedup_hash: string,            // For article-level deduplication
  dense_embedding: array,        // For semantic similarity
  sparse_embedding: json         // For keyword matching
})

// Events extracted from news or disclosures
(:Event {
  id: string,
  type: string,                  // Ontology category
  date: datetime,                // Date-indexed for temporal queries
  source: enum('DART', 'NEWS'),
  stock_symbol: string,
  content: text,
  metadata: json,

  // Deduplication (event-level, not just news-level)
  dedup_hash: string,            // For event deduplication across sources
  embedding_vector: array,       // Dense embedding for event similarity

  // Optional sentiment analysis (can be null in MVP)
  sentiment_score: float,        // -1.0 to 1.0, nullable
  sentiment_label: enum('positive', 'negative', 'neutral', 'unknown'),
  sentiment_confidence: float    // Extraction confidence for sentiment
})

// Stock entities with explicit sector/industry
(:Stock {
  symbol: string,
  name: string,
  sector: string,                // e.g., "AI Software", "Semiconductor"
  industry: string,              // e.g., "Information Technology"
  market_cap: string,            // e.g., "Large", "Mid", "Small"
  listed_market: enum('KOSPI', 'KOSDAQ')
})

// Price movements caused by events
(:PriceMovement {
  timeframe: enum('short', 'medium', 'long'),
  magnitude: float,              // Percentage change
  direction: enum('up', 'down', 'neutral'),
  start_date: datetime,
  end_date: datetime,
  measured_return: float
})

// Ontology categories for event classification
(:OntologyCategory {
  category_id: string,
  name: string,
  description: string,
  parent_category: string        // For hierarchical ontology
})

// Relationships
(:News)-[:CONTAINS {
  extraction_confidence: float,  // Confidence of event extraction
  extraction_method: string      // e.g., "LLM", "rule-based"
}]->(:Event)

(:Event)-[:AFFECTS]->(:Stock)

(:Event)-[:SIMILAR_TO {
  similarity_score: float,       // Embedding similarity
  match_criteria: string         // e.g., "ontology+industry+embedding"
}]->(:Event)

(:Event)-[:CAUSED]->(:PriceMovement)

(:PriceMovement)-[:FOR_STOCK]->(:Stock)

(:Event)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(:OntologyCategory)
```

**Key Schema Decisions:**

1. **Multi-Event Extraction:** One news article can contain multiple events
   - `(:News)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Event)` relationship supports 1-to-many
   - Events deduplicated separately from news (same event in multiple articles)

2. **Event-Level Deduplication:**
   - Both News AND Events have `dedup_hash`
   - Different news articles may contain same event → event dedup required

3. **Sentiment Analysis (Optional):**
   - `sentiment_score`, `sentiment_label`, `sentiment_confidence` can be null
   - Not required for MVP - historical price movement is ground truth
   - Computed asynchronously as auxiliary signal

4. **Explicit Stock Attributes:**
   - `sector` and `industry` explicitly defined for pattern matching
   - Essential for "similar events in similar industries" logic

5. **NOT Included in MVP:**
   - ❌ Inter-stock relationships (e.g., competitor, supplier, partner)
   - ❌ Multi-stock event attribution
   - These are deferred to Phase 2

**Rationale:**
- Simpler querying for pattern matching across all event types
- Source property allows filtering by pipeline (DART vs NEWS)
- Preserves existing ontology schema in stockelper-kg repository
- Extends current Neo4j structure without breaking changes

**Implementation Constraint:**
- Must review and extend existing ontology schema in `sources/kg/`
- Backward compatibility required with existing knowledge graph queries
- Add new node labels and relationships alongside existing structures

#### News Deduplication Strategy (Decision 2)

**Choice:** Hybrid Dense + Sparse Embedding Model

**Approach:**
1. **Dense Embeddings:** Semantic similarity using OpenAI embeddings or sentence transformers
   - Capture semantic meaning and context
   - Cosine similarity threshold: 0.9+ indicates duplicate
2. **Sparse Embeddings:** Keyword-based matching (TF-IDF, BM25)
   - Exact term matching for company names, dates, numbers
   - Catches variations in phrasing with same facts
3. **Hybrid Scoring:** Combined score = 0.6 × dense + 0.4 × sparse
   - Threshold: 0.85+ = duplicate article

**Implementation:**
- Store embeddings in MongoDB alongside news articles
- Dedup check runs before event extraction
- Track dedup effectiveness metrics (precision/recall)
- Dedup_hash stored in Event nodes for audit trail

**Rationale:**
- Industry best practice for news deduplication
- Dense captures semantic similarity (paraphrased content)
- Sparse catches exact fact matches (same company/event)
- More robust than simple hash or fuzzy matching

#### Data Collection Frequencies (Decision 5)

**Scheduled Data Pipelines:**

| Data Source | Airflow DAG | Frequency | Timing | Target Storage |
|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| News Articles | `dag_news_crawling` | Every 3 hours | During market hours | MongoDB → Neo4j (after extraction) |
| Closing Prices | `dag_closing_prices_daily` | Once daily | After market close (~3:30 PM KST) | PostgreSQL + Neo4j (PriceMovement) |
| DART Disclosures | `dag_dart_disclosure_daily` | Once daily | Morning (8:00 AM) | MongoDB → Neo4j (after extraction) |
| Competitor Info | `dag_competitor_info_daily` | Once daily | TBD | MongoDB/Neo4j |
| Securities Reports | `dag_securities_reports_daily` | Once daily | TBD | MongoDB/Neo4j |
| Portfolio Recs | `dag_portfolio_recommendations` | Once daily | 9:00 AM KST | PostgreSQL (user recommendations) |
| Event Processing | `dag_event_pattern_matching` | Event-triggered | After event extraction | Neo4j (SIMILAR_TO relationships) |

**Rationale:**
- News every 3 hours: Balance between timeliness and API rate limits
- Closing prices after market: Official daily data for backtesting
- DART morning check: Disclosures often released overnight
- Portfolio recs at 9 AM: Before market opens (9:00 AM KST)
- Event processing triggered: Real-time pattern matching after new events

### Event Intelligence Architecture

#### Event Pattern Matching Algorithm (Decision 3)

**Choice:** Subgraph Pattern Matching (Ontology + Industry)

**Algorithm:**
```cypher
// Find similar historical events
MATCH (new_event:Event)-[:AFFECTS]->(stock:Stock)
MATCH (historical:Event)-[:AFFECTS]->(similar_stock:Stock)
WHERE historical.type = new_event.type
  AND similar_stock.industry = stock.industry
  AND historical.date < new_event.date
  AND historical.id <> new_event.id
WITH historical,
     gds.similarity.cosine(new_event.embedding_vector, historical.embedding_vector) AS embedding_similarity
WHERE embedding_similarity > 0.75
MATCH (historical)-[:CAUSED]->(pm:PriceMovement)
RETURN historical, pm, embedding_similarity
ORDER BY historical.date DESC, embedding_similarity DESC
LIMIT 10
```

**Matching Criteria:**
1. **Primary:** Same ontology event category (e.g., "factory expansion", "FDA approval")
2. **Secondary:** Same stock industry classification (e.g., "semiconductor", "pharmaceuticals")
3. **Tertiary:** Embedding similarity score > 0.75 (semantic similarity)
4. **Result:** Historical events that match all three criteria

**Confidence Calculation:**
- Number of historical instances found (more = higher confidence)
- Consistency of price movements (all up/down = higher confidence)
- Recency weighting (recent patterns weighted higher)
- Embedding similarity scores (higher similarity = higher confidence)

**Rationale:**
- Leverages Neo4j graph structure (subgraph matching)
- Explainable to users ("similar factory expansions in semiconductor industry")
- Fast graph queries (indexed on type, industry, date)
- Can evolve to add dimensions (market cap, economic indicators) post-MVP

### API & Communication Patterns

#### REST API Endpoints (Decision 7)

**Choice:** RESTful API Design (matches existing Next.js API routes)

**New Endpoints:**

**Event & Prediction APIs:**
```typescript
// Query historical events
POST /api/events/query
Body: { stock_symbol: string, event_type?: string, date_range?: {start, end} }
Response: { events: Event[], total: number }

// Get event-based predictions
GET /api/predictions/{stock_symbol}
Query: ?timeframe=short|medium|long
Response: {
  predictions: Prediction[],
  confidence: number,
  historical_patterns: Event[]
}

// Get event details with similar historical events
GET /api/events/{event_id}/similar
Response: {
  event: Event,
  similar_events: Event[],
  price_movements: PriceMovement[]
}
```

**Backtesting APIs:**
```typescript
// Trigger async backtesting
POST /api/backtesting/execute
Body: { stock_symbol: string, strategy_type: string }
Response: { job_id: string, status: 'queued' }

// Check backtesting progress
GET /api/backtesting/{job_id}/status
Response: {
  job_id: string,
  status: 'queued'|'running'|'completed'|'failed',
  progress_pct: number,
  result?: BacktestResult
}

// Get completed backtest results
GET /api/backtesting/{job_id}/result
Response: {
  sharpe_ratio: number,
  returns: {three_month, six_month, twelve_month},
  comparison: 'outperform'|'underperform'
}
```

**Recommendation APIs:**
```typescript
// Get daily portfolio recommendations (precomputed at 9 AM)
GET /api/recommendations/daily
Response: {
  recommendations: Recommendation[],
  generated_at: datetime,
  based_on_date: date  // Previous day's closing prices
}

// Get recommendation details with rationale
GET /api/recommendations/{rec_id}
Response: {
  recommendation: Recommendation,
  event_rationale: Event[],
  historical_evidence: PriceMovement[],
  confidence: number
}
```

**Notification APIs:**
```typescript
// Poll for new notifications (badge counter)
GET /api/notifications/unread
Response: {
  count: number,
  notifications: Notification[]
}

// Mark notifications as read
POST /api/notifications/{notification_id}/read
Response: { success: boolean }

// Get notification details
GET /api/notifications/{notification_id}
Response: {
  notification: Notification,
  event: Event,
  prediction: Prediction
}
```

**API Design Patterns:**
- Follow existing Next.js API route structure (`/app/api/...`)
- JWT authentication on all endpoints (existing pattern)
- Error handling: Consistent error response format
- Rate limiting: Applied via existing middleware
- Async operations: Job ID pattern for long-running tasks (backtesting)

**Rationale:**
- Matches existing Next.js API routes pattern
- RESTful conventions familiar to team
- Async job pattern for time-consuming backtesting
- Badge notification polling (30-60s interval) meets NFR-P6 (5min alert requirement)

### User Experience Architecture

#### Notification Delivery (Decision 4)

**Choice:** Badge Notification System with Polling

**Pattern:** "Notification Badge" / "Badge Counter"

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Frontend: Notification Badge Component
<NotificationBell
  unreadCount={notifications.length}
  isAnimated={hasNewNotification}
/>

// Polling mechanism (React hook)
useEffect(() => {
  const interval = setInterval(async () => {
    const { count, notifications } = await fetch('/api/notifications/unread');
    setUnreadCount(count);
    if (count > previousCount) {
      triggerBadgeAnimation();
    }
  }, 30000); // 30-second polling
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
```

**Visual States:**
- **No notifications:** Bell icon (default state)
- **Unread notifications:** Bell icon + badge counter (red dot with number)
- **New notification arrived:** Animated bell icon + badge (shake/bounce animation)
- **Notification center open:** Drawer/modal showing notification list

**User Flow:**
1. New event matches user's portfolio
2. Backend creates notification in PostgreSQL
3. Frontend polls `/api/notifications/unread` every 30s
4. Badge counter updates, bell icon animates
5. User clicks bell → notification center opens
6. User views notification → marks as read

**Rationale:**
- Standard UI pattern (Gmail, GitHub, LinkedIn)
- Simple implementation (no WebSocket infrastructure for MVP)
- Meets NFR-P6: Event alerts within 5 minutes (30s polling achieves this)
- Can upgrade to WebSocket/Push post-MVP for true real-time

### Infrastructure & Orchestration

#### Airflow DAG Structure (Decision 6)

**Choice:** 7 Separate DAGs (Maximum Separation)

**DAG Definitions:**

**1. `dag_news_crawling` (Every 3 hours)**
```python
schedule_interval='0 */3 * * *'  # Every 3 hours at :00
tasks:
  - crawl_naver_securities_news
  - crawl_toss_securities_news
  - store_raw_news_mongodb
  - trigger_deduplication
  - trigger_event_extraction
```

**2. `dag_closing_prices_daily` (After market close)**
```python
schedule_interval='30 15 * * 1-5'  # 3:30 PM KST, weekdays
tasks:
  - fetch_closing_prices_kis_api
  - store_prices_postgresql
  - update_price_movements_neo4j
  - trigger_event_pattern_matching
```

**3. `dag_dart_disclosure_daily` (Morning check)**
```python
schedule_interval='0 8 * * 1-5'  # 8:00 AM KST, weekdays
tasks:
  - check_new_dart_disclosures
  - download_disclosure_documents
  - store_raw_disclosures_mongodb
  - trigger_event_extraction
```

**4. `dag_competitor_info_daily`**
```python
schedule_interval='0 10 * * 1-5'  # 10:00 AM KST, weekdays
tasks:
  - collect_competitor_data
  - store_competitor_info
  - update_knowledge_graph
```

**5. `dag_securities_reports_daily`**
```python
schedule_interval='0 11 * * 1-5'  # 11:00 AM KST, weekdays
tasks:
  - collect_securities_firm_reports
  - summarize_reports
  - store_summaries
  - extract_insights
```

**6. `dag_portfolio_recommendations` (9:00 AM daily)**
```python
schedule_interval='0 9 * * 1-5'  # 9:00 AM KST, weekdays
tasks:
  - fetch_user_portfolios
  - generate_recommendations  # Uses existing LLM service logic
  - store_recommendations_postgresql
  - send_notification_triggers
```

**7. `dag_event_pattern_matching` (Event-triggered)**
```python
schedule_interval=None  # Triggered by other DAGs
tasks:
  - find_similar_historical_events  # Subgraph matching
  - calculate_confidence_scores
  - generate_predictions
  - create_user_notifications
  - store_pattern_results
```

**DAG Dependencies:**
```
dag_news_crawling → dag_event_pattern_matching
dag_dart_disclosure_daily → dag_event_pattern_matching
dag_closing_prices_daily → dag_event_pattern_matching
dag_event_pattern_matching → (user notifications created)
```

**Rationale:**
- Follows existing Airflow DAG conventions (separate files)
- Independent failure isolation (one DAG failure doesn't block others)
- Clear scheduling per business requirement
- Event-driven pattern matching triggered after data updates
- Easier monitoring, debugging, and retry logic per DAG

### Critical Technical Updates

#### LangChain v1.0+ Compliance - ✅ VERIFIED (2025-12-29)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - No migration required

**Verification Findings (2025-12-29):**
- ✅ Codebase already uses LangChain v1.0+ compliant StateGraph patterns
- ✅ BaseAnalysisAgent uses `StateGraph(SubState)` - v1.0+ compliant
- ✅ SupervisorAgent uses `StateGraph(State)` - v1.0+ compliant
- ✅ All 5 analysis agents inherit BaseAnalysisAgent - automatically v1.0+ compliant
- ✅ No deprecated `langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent` usage found
- ✅ Dependencies include `langchain>=1.0.0` and `langchain-classic>=1.0.0`

**Architecture Pattern:**
- Direct StateGraph construction (more advanced than helper functions)
- Recommended pattern for complex multi-agent systems per LangChain v1.0+ docs
- Maximum flexibility for custom node logic and routing

**Revised Focus:**
- Model upgrades: gpt-5.1/gpt-5.1-mini → gpt-5.1
- Message handling validation and testing
- Comprehensive integration testing with StateGraph implementation

**Deferred to Implementation:**
- Specific migration steps documented in tech specs
- Breaking changes identified during codebase review
- LangGraph agent restructuring based on v1.0 patterns

### Decision Impact Analysis

**Implementation Sequence:**

1. **Foundation (Weeks 1-2):**
   - LangChain v1.0+ migration (existing LLM service)
   - Neo4j schema extension (preserve existing ontology)
   - PostgreSQL schema additions (alert preferences, recommendations)

2. **Data Pipelines (Weeks 3-4):**
   - Implement 7 Airflow DAGs following existing conventions
   - News deduplication (hybrid embeddings)
   - Event extraction integration

3. **Event Intelligence (Weeks 5-6):**
   - Subgraph pattern matching algorithm
   - Confidence calculation logic
   - Price movement measurement

4. **User-Facing Features (Weeks 7-8):**
   - REST API endpoints (prediction, backtesting, recommendations)
   - Badge notification system (frontend + backend)
   - Chat interface integration

5. **Testing & Refinement (Weeks 9-10):**
   - End-to-end testing of event pipelines
   - Backtesting validation
   - User acceptance testing

**Cross-Component Dependencies:**

- **Neo4j Schema** affects: Event extraction, pattern matching, prediction engine
- **Deduplication** affects: Knowledge graph quality, prediction accuracy
- **Airflow DAGs** affect: Data freshness, alert timeliness, recommendation scheduling
- **REST APIs** affect: Frontend integration, chat interface, user experience
- **Badge Notifications** affect: User engagement, alert effectiveness

**Risk Mitigation:**

- LangChain v1.0+ migration is critical path → prioritize first
- Deduplication effectiveness impacts all downstream features → monitor metrics closely
- Airflow DAG failures isolated → robust retry and error handling required
- Pattern matching algorithm accuracy → backtesting validation before production

## Implementation Patterns & Consistency Rules

### Overview

This section defines mandatory implementation patterns that **all AI agents must follow** when implementing features for Stockelper. These patterns prevent conflicts between agents working on different parts of the system and ensure code compatibility.

**Critical Conflict Points Identified:** 8 major categories where AI agents could make incompatible choices

---

### 1. Database Naming Conventions

#### Neo4j Naming Standards

**Node Labels:**
- **Format:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `:Event`, `:Company`, `:Document`)
- **Singular form:** Always use singular (`:Event` not `:Events`)

**Property Names:**
- **Format:** `snake_case` for ALL properties
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `sentiment_score`, `dedup_hash`, `event_type`, `published_date`
  - ❌ `sentimentScore`, `dedupHash`, `eventType`, `publishedDate`

**Relationship Types:**
- **Format:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `:CONTAINS`, `:SIMILAR_TO`, `:OCCURRED_ON`)
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `HAS_SECURITY`, `INVOLVED_IN`, `CAUSED`, `BELONGS_TO`
  - ❌ `has_security`, `InvolvedIn`, `caused`

**Example:**
```cypher
(:Event {
  event_id: "EVT_001",
  sentiment_score: 0.75,
  dedup_hash: "abc123",
  published_date: "2025-12-17T18:54:00Z"
})-[:OCCURRED_ON]->(:Date {date: "2025-12-17"})
```

#### PostgreSQL Naming Standards

**Table Names:**
- **Format:** `snake_case`, plural form
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `daily_stock_prices`, `user_portfolios`, `notification_preferences`
  - ❌ `DailyStockPrice`, `userPortfolio`, `NotificationPreferences`

**Column Names:**
- **Format:** `snake_case` for ALL columns
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `stock_symbol`, `adj_close`, `created_at`, `user_id`
  - ❌ `stockSymbol`, `adjClose`, `createdAt`, `userId`

**Foreign Keys:**
- **Format:** `{referenced_table_singular}_id`
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `user_id`, `stock_id`, `event_id`
  - ❌ `fk_user`, `userId`, `user_fk`

**Indexes:**
- **Format:** `idx_{table}_{columns}`
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `idx_daily_stock_prices_symbol_date`, `idx_users_email`
  - ❌ `daily_stock_prices_symbol_date_index`, `users_email_idx`

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE daily_stock_prices (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  stock_symbol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  trade_date DATE NOT NULL,
  adj_close NUMERIC(15, 2),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(stock_symbol, trade_date)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_daily_stock_prices_symbol_date 
  ON daily_stock_prices(stock_symbol, trade_date);
```

#### MongoDB Naming Standards

**Collection Names:**
- **Format:** `snake_case`, plural form
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `news_articles`, `scraped_disclosures`, `event_metadata`
  - ❌ `newsArticles`, `scrapedDisclosure`, `EventMetadata`

**Document Field Names:**
- **Format:** `snake_case` for ALL fields (consistent with Neo4j/PostgreSQL)
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `news_id`, `published_date`, `dedup_hash`, `dense_embedding`
  - ❌ `newsId`, `publishedDate`, `dedupHash`, `denseEmbedding`

**Example:**

  "published_date": "2025-12-17T18:54:00Z",
  "source": "NAVER_SECURITIES",
  "dedup_hash": "abc123def456",
  "dense_embedding": [0.1, 0.2, ...],
  "created_at": "2025-12-17T19:00:00Z"
}
```

---

### 2. API Naming & Response Patterns

#### REST Endpoint Naming

**Resource Naming:**
- **Format:** Plural nouns (`/predictions`, `/recommendations`, `/notifications`)
- **URL structure:** `/api/{resource}` or `/api/{resource}/{id}`
- **Path parameters:** `{parameter_name}` format (e.g., `{stock_symbol}`)

**Examples:**
```
✅ GET  /api/predictions/{stock_symbol}
✅ POST /api/backtesting/execute
✅ GET  /api/recommendations/daily
✅ GET  /api/notifications/unread

❌ GET  /api/prediction/{stock_symbol}      (singular)
❌ POST /api/backtest                        (inconsistent)
❌ GET  /api/recommendation/today            (singular)
```

#### Query Parameters

**Format:** `snake_case`
```
✅ GET /api/predictions/{stock_symbol}?timeframe=short&confidence_min=0.7
❌ GET /api/predictions/{stock_symbol}?timeFrame=short&confidenceMin=0.7
```

#### Response Format Standards

**Success Response (Direct - No Wrapper):**
```typescript
// Single object
{
  "prediction": {
    "stock_symbol": "005930",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "timeframe": "short"
  },
  "historical_patterns": [...]
}

// Array
[
  {"recommendation_id": "rec_001", ...},
  {"recommendation_id": "rec_002", ...}
]
```

**Error Response (Simple Format):**
```typescript
{
  "error": "Stock symbol not found"
}

// With optional detail for development
{
  "error": "Validation failed: sentiment_score must be between -1 and 1"
}
```

#### HTTP Status Code Usage

**Standard Mappings:**
- **200 OK:** Successful GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE
- **201 Created:** Successful POST that creates resource
- **400 Bad Request:** Validation errors, malformed request
- **401 Unauthorized:** Authentication required or failed
- **403 Forbidden:** Authenticated but not authorized
- **404 Not Found:** Resource doesn't exist
- **500 Internal Server Error:** Unexpected server error

**Example:**
```python
# FastAPI endpoint
@app.get("/api/predictions/{stock_symbol}")
async def get_prediction(stock_symbol: str):
    if not is_valid_symbol(stock_symbol):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail={"error": "Invalid stock symbol format"})
    
    prediction = await prediction_service.get(stock_symbol)
    if not prediction:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail={"error": "Stock symbol not found"})
    
    return prediction  # Direct response, no wrapper
```

---

### 3. Code Naming Conventions

#### Python Naming Standards

**Functions & Variables:**
- **Format:** `snake_case`
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `get_user_portfolio()`, `calculate_sharpe_ratio()`, `event_id`, `sentiment_score`
  - ❌ `getUserPortfolio()`, `calculateSharpeRatio()`, `eventId`, `sentimentScore`

**Classes:**
- **Format:** `PascalCase`
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `BacktestInput`, `EventExtractionService`, `PredictionEngine`
  - ❌ `backtest_input`, `eventExtractionService`, `prediction_engine`

**Constants:**
- **Format:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `MAX_POSITIONS`, `DEFAULT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`, `API_TIMEOUT`
  - ❌ `maxPositions`, `defaultConfidenceThreshold`, `ApiTimeout`

**Private Methods:**
- **Format:** `_snake_case` (single leading underscore)
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `_calculate_embedding()`, `_validate_event_type()`
  - ❌ `__calculate_embedding()`, `calculateEmbedding()`

**Example:**
```python
class EventExtractionService:
    MAX_RETRIES = 3
    DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30
    
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self._client = self._initialize_client()
    
    def extract_events(self, news_text: str) -> List[Event]:
        """Extract events from news text."""
        return self._process_extraction(news_text)
    
    def _process_extraction(self, text: str) -> List[Event]:
        """Private helper for extraction logic."""
        pass
```

#### TypeScript/React Naming Standards

**Components (Files & Functions):**
- **File format:** `PascalCase.tsx`
- **Component name:** Must match filename
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `NotificationBadge.tsx` exports `NotificationBadge`
  - ✅ `PredictionChart.tsx` exports `PredictionChart`
  - ❌ `notification-badge.tsx` exports `NotificationBadge`
  - ❌ `PredictionChart.tsx` exports `Chart`

**Functions & Variables:**
- **Format:** `camelCase`
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `getUserPortfolio()`, `calculateConfidence()`, `stockSymbol`, `sentimentScore`
  - ❌ `get_user_portfolio()`, `calculate_confidence()`, `stock_symbol`, `sentiment_score`

**Interfaces & Types:**
- **Format:** `PascalCase`
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `interface Prediction {}`, `type BacktestResult = {}`
  - ❌ `interface prediction {}`, `type backtestResult = {}`

**Constants:**
- **Format:** `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ `const MAX_CHART_POINTS = 100;`, `const API_BASE_URL = "...";`
  - ❌ `const maxChartPoints = 100;`, `const apiBaseUrl = "...";`

**Example:**
```typescript
// NotificationBadge.tsx
interface NotificationBadgeProps {
  unreadCount: number;
  isAnimated: boolean;
}

const MAX_DISPLAY_COUNT = 99;

export function NotificationBadge({ unreadCount, isAnimated }: NotificationBadgeProps) {
  const displayCount = unreadCount > MAX_DISPLAY_COUNT ? "99+" : unreadCount;
  
  return (
    <div className={isAnimated ? "badge-animated" : "badge"}>
      {displayCount}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 4. File & Directory Organization

#### Frontend Structure (Next.js)

**Organization Pattern:** By feature/domain

```
/app
  /api                          # API routes
    /predictions
      /[stock_symbol]
        /route.ts
    /backtesting
      /execute
        /route.ts
  /notifications                # Feature: Notifications
    /components
      NotificationBadge.tsx
      NotificationBadge.test.tsx
      NotificationList.tsx
      NotificationList.test.tsx
    /hooks
      useNotifications.ts
      useNotifications.test.ts
    /utils
      notification-helpers.ts
    page.tsx
  /portfolio                    # Feature: Portfolio
    /components
      PortfolioSummary.tsx
      PortfolioSummary.test.tsx
    /hooks
      usePortfolio.ts
    page.tsx
  /predictions                  # Feature: Predictions
    /components
      PredictionChart.tsx
      PredictionChart.test.tsx
    /hooks
      usePredictions.ts
    page.tsx
```

**Test Files:** Co-located with implementation
- ✅ `NotificationBadge.tsx` + `NotificationBadge.test.tsx` (same directory)
- ❌ `/tests/notifications/NotificationBadge.test.tsx` (separate)

#### Backend Structure (FastAPI)

**Organization Pattern:** By feature/domain

```
/src
  /services
    /prediction                 # Prediction service domain
      __init__.py
      service.py
      models.py
      repository.py
      test_service.py           # Co-located tests
    /backtesting               # Backtesting service domain
      __init__.py
      service.py
      portfolio_strategy.py
      test_strategy.py
    /event_extraction          # Event extraction domain
      __init__.py
      service.py
      ontology.py
  /airflow
    /dags
      dag_news_crawling.py
      dag_closing_prices_daily.py
      dag_dart_disclosure_daily.py
      dag_event_pattern_matching.py
    /tasks
      event_extraction_tasks.py
      news_crawling_tasks.py
```

---

### 5. Airflow DAG Patterns

#### DAG Naming Convention

**Format:** `dag_` prefix + `snake_case`

**Examples:**
```python
✅ dag_news_crawling
✅ dag_closing_prices_daily
✅ dag_dart_disclosure_daily
✅ dag_event_pattern_matching
✅ dag_portfolio_recommendations

❌ news-crawling-dag
❌ NewsCrawlingDAG
❌ dag_NewsCrawling
```

#### Task Naming Convention

**Format:** `snake_case` (descriptive verb + noun)

**Examples:**
```python
dag = DAG('dag_news_crawling', ...)

tasks:
  ✅ crawl_naver_securities_news
  ✅ crawl_toss_securities_news
  ✅ store_raw_news_mongodb
  ✅ trigger_deduplication
  ✅ trigger_event_extraction

  ❌ crawlNaverSecuritiesNews
  ❌ task_1
  ❌ naver_crawl
```

#### XCom Key Naming (Task Communication)

**Format:** `{source_task}_{data_type}`

**Examples:**
```python
# Task outputs data
task_instance.xcom_push(key='crawl_naver_news_articles', value=articles)

# Task reads data
articles = task_instance.xcom_pull(key='crawl_naver_news_articles', task_ids='crawl_naver_securities_news')
```

**Standard XCom patterns:**
- Use descriptive keys that identify both source and data type
- Keep keys in `snake_case`
- Document expected data structure in task docstrings

---

### 6. Date/Time Format Standards

#### API Request/Response Format

**Standard:** ISO 8601 strings in UTC

**Examples:**
```typescript
✅ "2025-12-17T18:54:00Z"           // Full datetime with timezone
✅ "2025-12-17"                     // Date only (for date fields)

❌ 1734459240000                    // Unix timestamp
❌ "2025-12-17 18:54:00"           // Missing timezone
❌ "12/17/2025"                    // Locale-specific format
```

**JSON Field Examples:**
```json
{
  "event_id": "EVT_001",
  "published_date": "2025-12-17T18:54:00Z",
  "trade_date": "2025-12-17",
  "created_at": "2025-12-17T19:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Neo4j datetime Properties

**Format:** Align with API standard (ISO 8601 strings)

```cypher
CREATE (:Event {
  event_id: "EVT_001",
  date: datetime("2025-12-17T18:54:00Z"),
  reported_at: datetime("2025-12-17T18:54:00Z")
})

CREATE (:Date {
  date: "2025-12-17",
  year: 2025,
  month: 12,
  day: 17
})
```

#### Python datetime Handling

**Standard Library:**
```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

# Always store/transmit in UTC
now = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
iso_string = now.isoformat()  # "2025-12-17T18:54:00+00:00"

# Parse ISO strings
parsed = datetime.fromisoformat("2025-12-17T18:54:00Z")
```

#### TypeScript Date Handling

**Standard:**
```typescript
// Parse ISO string from API
const eventDate = new Date("2025-12-17T18:54:00Z");

// Convert to ISO string for API
const isoString = eventDate.toISOString();  // "2025-12-17T18:54:00.000Z"

// Format for display (use date-fns or similar)
import { format } from 'date-fns';
const displayDate = format(eventDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm');
```

---

### 7. Error Handling Patterns

#### Frontend Error Handling

**Pattern:** Error boundaries for unexpected errors + inline handling for expected errors

**Error Boundary (Unexpected Errors):**
```typescript
// app/error.tsx (Next.js convention)
'use client';

export default function Error({
  error,
  reset,
}: {
  error: Error & { digest?: string };
  reset: () => void;
}) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
      <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Inline Handling (Expected Errors):**
```typescript
// Component handling expected API errors
async function fetchPredictions(symbol: string) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`/api/predictions/${symbol}`);
    
    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorData = await response.json();
      throw new Error(errorData.error || 'Failed to fetch predictions');
    }
    
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle expected errors inline
    setError(error.message);
    return null;
  }
}
```

#### Backend Error Handling (FastAPI)

**Error Response Format:** Simple `{"error": "message"}`

**HTTP Exception Usage:**
```python
from fastapi import HTTPException

@app.get("/api/predictions/{stock_symbol}")
async def get_prediction(stock_symbol: str):
    # Validation error
    if not is_valid_symbol(stock_symbol):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400,
            detail={"error": "Invalid stock symbol format"}
        )
    
    # Not found
    prediction = await prediction_service.get(stock_symbol)
    if not prediction:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=404,
            detail={"error": "Stock symbol not found"}
        )
    
    # Unexpected errors handled by global exception handler
    return prediction
```

**Global Exception Handler:**
```python
@app.exception_handler(Exception)
async def global_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: Exception):
    logger.error(f"Unhandled exception: {exc}", exc_info=True)
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=500,
        content={"error": "Internal server error"}
    )
```

#### Airflow Error Handling

**Task Retry Configuration:**
```python
default_args = {
    'retries': 3,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
    'retry_exponential_backoff': True,
    'max_retry_delay': timedelta(hours=1),
}

dag = DAG(
    'dag_news_crawling',
    default_args=default_args,
    catchup=False,
)
```

**Task Failure Callbacks:**
```python
def task_failure_alert(context):
    """Send alert on task failure after all retries."""
    logger.error(f"Task {context['task_instance'].task_id} failed")
    # Implement notification logic

task = PythonOperator(
    task_id='crawl_news',
    python_callable=crawl_news,
    on_failure_callback=task_failure_alert,
    dag=dag,
)
```

### 8. Enforcement Guidelines

#### All AI Agents MUST

1. **Follow naming conventions exactly** as specified for each technology (Neo4j, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python, TypeScript)
2. **Use established directory structure** (by feature/domain organization)
3. **Return direct API responses** (no wrapper objects) with standard HTTP status codes
4. **Use ISO 8601 datetime format** in all APIs and database storage
5. **Co-locate test files** with implementation files
6. **Follow Airflow DAG naming** (`dag_` prefix + `snake_case`)
7. **Handle errors consistently** (error boundaries + inline handling for frontend, HTTPException for backend)
8. **Use snake_case for all database fields** (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j properties)
9. **Use PascalCase for React components** and camelCase for TypeScript functions
10. **Follow Python PEP 8** conventions (snake_case functions, PascalCase classes)

#### Pattern Verification

**Before Implementation:**
- Review this document for the specific technology being used
- Verify naming matches established patterns
- Check directory structure aligns with feature organization

**During Code Review:**
- Validate all names follow conventions
- Check error responses match standard format
- Verify datetime fields use ISO 8601
- Confirm file organization follows feature-based structure

**Pattern Violations:**
- Document in code review comments
- Reference this architecture document section
- Require correction before merge

#### Updating Patterns

**Process for Pattern Changes:**
1. Propose change with rationale in architecture review
2. Assess impact on existing code
3. Update this document first
4. Communicate to all team members
5. Update existing code to match (if necessary)

**Do NOT:**
- Deviate from patterns without architecture review
- Mix patterns (e.g., some endpoints with wrappers, some without)
- Create team-specific conventions that differ from this document

---

### 9. Pattern Examples

#### ✅ Good Examples

**Neo4j Query Following Patterns:**
```cypher
// All property names in snake_case
MATCH (e:Event)-[:OCCURRED_ON]->(d:Date)
WHERE e.sentiment_score > 0.7
  AND d.date >= "2025-01-01"
  AND e.event_type = "SUPPLY_CAPACITY_CHANGE"
RETURN e.event_id, e.sentiment_score, e.published_date, d.date
```

**PostgreSQL Schema Following Patterns:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_portfolios (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  stock_symbol VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
  purchase_date DATE NOT NULL,
  purchase_price NUMERIC(15, 2),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_user_portfolios_user_id 
  ON user_portfolios(user_id);
```

**FastAPI Endpoint Following Patterns:**
```python
@app.get("/api/predictions/{stock_symbol}")
async def get_predictions(
    stock_symbol: str,
    timeframe: str = "medium",
    confidence_min: float = 0.5
):
    """Get event-based predictions for a stock."""
    if not validate_stock_symbol(stock_symbol):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=400,
            detail={"error": "Invalid stock symbol format"}
        )
    
    predictions = await prediction_service.get_predictions(
        stock_symbol=stock_symbol,
        timeframe=timeframe,
        min_confidence=confidence_min
    )
    
    if not predictions:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=404,
            detail={"error": "No predictions found for this stock"}
        )
    
    return {
        "stock_symbol": stock_symbol,
        "predictions": predictions,
        "generated_at": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()
    }
```

**React Component Following Patterns:**
```typescript
// NotificationBadge.tsx
interface NotificationBadgeProps {
  unreadCount: number;
  isAnimated: boolean;
  onClick: () => void;
}

export function NotificationBadge({ 
  unreadCount, 
  isAnimated, 
  onClick 
}: NotificationBadgeProps) {
  const displayCount = unreadCount > 99 ? "99+" : unreadCount.toString();
  
  const handleClick = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/notifications/unread');
      if (!response.ok) {
        const errorData = await response.json();
        throw new Error(errorData.error);
      }
      const data = await response.json();
      onClick();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Failed to fetch notifications:', error);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <button 
      onClick={handleClick}
      className={isAnimated ? "badge-animated" : "badge"}
    >
      {displayCount}
    </button>
  );
}
```

**Airflow DAG Following Patterns:**
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

default_args = {
    'owner': 'stockelper',
    'retries': 3,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
}

dag = DAG(
    'dag_news_crawling',
    default_args=default_args,
    description='Crawl news every 3 hours',
    schedule_interval='0 */3 * * *',
    start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1),
    catchup=False,
)

def crawl_naver_securities_news(**context):
    """Crawl Naver Securities news articles."""
    articles = news_crawler.crawl_naver()
    context['task_instance'].xcom_push(
        key='crawl_naver_news_articles',
        value=articles
    )

def store_raw_news_mongodb(**context):
    """Store crawled articles in MongoDB."""
    articles = context['task_instance'].xcom_pull(
        key='crawl_naver_news_articles',
        task_ids='crawl_naver_securities_news'
    )
    mongodb_client.insert_many('news_articles', articles)

task_crawl_naver = PythonOperator(
    task_id='crawl_naver_securities_news',
    python_callable=crawl_naver_securities_news,
    dag=dag,
)

task_store_mongodb = PythonOperator(
    task_id='store_raw_news_mongodb',
    python_callable=store_raw_news_mongodb,
    dag=dag,
)

task_crawl_naver >> task_store_mongodb
```

#### ❌ Anti-Patterns (What to Avoid)

**Mixed Naming Conventions:**
```python
# ❌ Don't mix snake_case and camelCase
class EventService:
    def getUserEvents(self, user_id):  # ❌ camelCase function
        events = self.db.query(Event).filter(Event.userId == user_id)  # ❌ camelCase column
        return events
```

**Inconsistent API Responses:**
```python
# ❌ Don't mix wrapped and direct responses
@app.get("/api/predictions/{symbol}")
async def get_prediction(symbol: str):
    return {"data": prediction, "error": None}  # ❌ Wrapper (we chose direct)

@app.get("/api/backtesting/{id}")
async def get_backtest(id: str):
    return backtest_result  # ✅ Direct response (inconsistent with above)
```

**Wrong Directory Organization:**
```
# ❌ Don't organize by type when pattern is by feature
/components
  NotificationBadge.tsx
  PortfolioSummary.tsx
  PredictionChart.tsx
/hooks
  useNotifications.ts
  usePortfolio.ts
  usePredictions.ts

# ✅ Organize by feature
/notifications
  /components
    NotificationBadge.tsx
  /hooks
    useNotifications.ts
/portfolio
  /components
    PortfolioSummary.tsx
  /hooks
    usePortfolio.ts
```

**Inconsistent Date Formats:**
```typescript
// ❌ Don't mix date formats
{
  "event_date": "2025-12-17T18:54:00Z",      // ISO 8601 ✅
  "trade_date": 1734459240000,               // Unix timestamp ❌
  "created_at": "2025-12-17 18:54:00"       // Missing timezone ❌
}
```

**Non-Standard Error Responses:**
```python
# ❌ Don't create custom error formats
raise HTTPException(
    status_code=400,
    detail={
        "status": "error",
        "message": "Invalid input",
        "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR"
    }
)

# ✅ Use simple format
raise HTTPException(
    status_code=400,
    detail={"error": "Invalid input"}
)
```

- [ ] No time estimates in comments or documentation


## Project Structure & Boundaries

### Overview

Stockelper is a **brownfield microservices architecture** spanning **5 existing repositories** with **2 new services planned** (Backtesting Service, Portfolio Service). This section defines the complete project structure, architectural boundaries, and requirements mapping for all services.

**Note (Updated 2025-12-30):** Backtesting/Portfolio services will be split into separate repositories and integrated via service-to-service API calls and shared PostgreSQL persistence.

**Notification Architecture:** Uses Supabase Realtime for real-time database change notifications instead of custom notification service. Backend writes to PostgreSQL, Supabase Realtime detects changes, frontend subscribes and updates UI automatically.

#### **Repository 2: LLM Service (FastAPI + LangGraph)**

**Repository:** `stockelper-llm/`

**Purpose:** Core business logic for predictions, event extraction, and chat interface (including orchestration triggers for Backtesting/Portfolio services).

**Note (Updated 2025-12-30):** Backtesting and Portfolio logic are planned to be split into separate repositories:
- `stockelper-backtesting/` (local)
- `stockelper-portfolio/` (local)

**Technology Stack:** FastAPI, LangChain v1.0+, LangGraph, Python 3.12+, asyncpg, PyMongo, neo4j-driver

### Architectural Boundaries

#### API Boundaries

**External API Endpoints (Frontend → LLM Service):**

```
Frontend Next.js (Port 3000)
    ↓
Next.js API Routes (/app/api/*)
    ↓ HTTP REST
LLM Service FastAPI (Port 8000)
    ↓
Endpoints:
  - /api/predictions/{stock_symbol}
  - /api/backtesting/execute
  - /api/backtesting/{job_id}/status
  - /api/backtesting/{job_id}/result
  - /api/recommendations/daily
  - /api/recommendations/{rec_id}
  - /api/notifications/unread
  - /api/notifications/{notification_id}/read
  - /api/events/query
  - /api/events/{event_id}/similar
  - /api/chat
```

**Authentication Boundary:**
- **JWT Token Issuer:** Frontend (`/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`)
- **Token Format:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- **Token Validation:** LLM Service middleware (`src/middleware/auth.py`)
- **Token Expiration:** 24 hours (NFR-S4)
- **User Session Storage:** PostgreSQL `users` table (Prisma)

**Rate Limiting Boundary:**
- **Frontend Middleware:** `src/middleware.ts` (Next.js) - Per-IP limits
- **Backend Middleware:** `src/middleware/rate_limiter.py` (FastAPI) - Per-user limits
- **Applied To:** All `/api/*` routes
- **Limits:** Query throttling per NFR (FR98-FR103)

---

#### Component Boundaries

**Frontend Component Communication:**

1. **State Management:**
   - React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
   - No global state management library (Redux/Zustand) - Keep it simple
   - Context API for auth state only

2. **API Communication:**
   - Centralized client: `lib/api-client.ts`
   - All API calls go through this client (consistency)
   - Automatic JWT token attachment
   - Automatic error handling

3. **Polling Pattern:**
   - Notification polling: `useNotificationPolling` hook (30-second interval)
   - Badge notification counter update
   - Meets NFR-P6 (5-minute alert requirement)

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Error boundaries: `app/error.tsx` (unexpected errors)
   - Inline try/catch: Component-level (expected errors)
   - User-friendly error messages

**Backend Service Communication:**

1. **Internal (Within LLM Service):**
   - Direct Python function calls
   - Service → Repository → Database pattern
   - Async/await for I/O operations

2. **Cross-Service (LLM ↔ Neo4j):**
   - Cypher queries via neo4j-driver
   - Query library from `stockelper-kg/src/queries/`
   - Connection pooling for performance

3. **Event-Driven (Airflow → Services):**
   - Airflow DAG triggers HTTP POST to service endpoints
   - Example: `dag_event_pattern_matching.py` calls `POST /api/events/process_new_event`
   - XCom for inter-task data sharing

- **Authentication:** JWT in `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- **Error Handling:** Automatic retry with exponential backoff

**2. LLM Service ↔ Neo4j**
- **Protocol:** Bolt protocol (neo4j-driver)
- **Connection:** `stockelper-llm/src/database.py`
- **Queries:** Imported from `stockelper-kg/src/queries/pattern_matching.py`

**Framework-Specific Configs:**

**Frontend (Next.js):**
```
next.config.js                  # Next.js configuration
tsconfig.json                   # TypeScript compiler options
tailwind.config.js              # Tailwind CSS customization
prisma/schema.prisma            # Database schema (Prisma ORM)
```

**Backend (Python):**
```
pyproject.toml                  # Modern Python project config (PEP 518)
requirements.txt                # Pip dependencies
src/config.py                   # Application configuration
```

**Airflow:**
```
docker-compose.yml              # Airflow services (webserver, scheduler, worker)
config/airflow.cfg              # Airflow configuration
```

#### Source Code Organization Patterns

**Frontend Pattern: Feature-Based Organization**

```
/app
  /{feature}/                   # Feature module (portfolio, predictions, etc.)
    page.tsx                    # Next.js page component
    /components/                # Feature-specific components
      Component.tsx
      Component.test.tsx        # Co-located tests
    /hooks/                     # Feature-specific hooks
      useFeature.ts
      useFeature.test.ts
```

**Backend Pattern: Domain-Driven Organization**

```
/src
  /services
    /{domain}/                  # Service domain (prediction, portfolio, etc.)
      service.py                # Main service logic
      test_service.py           # Co-located tests
      models.py                 # Data models (Pydantic)
      repository.py             # Database access
```

**Airflow Pattern: DAG + Tasks**

```
/dags
  dag_feature_name.py           # DAG definition (schedule, tasks)

/tasks
  feature_tasks.py              # Reusable task functions
```

#### Test Organization Patterns

**Co-Located Tests (Primary Pattern):**

```
/app/portfolio/
  components/
    PortfolioSummary.tsx
    PortfolioSummary.test.tsx   # ✅ Co-located

/src/services/prediction/
  service.py
  test_service.py               # ✅ Co-located
```

**Separate E2E Tests:**

```
/tests/
  e2e/                          # End-to-end tests (separate)
    portfolio.spec.ts
    predictions.spec.ts
```

**Test Utilities:**

```
/tests/
  __mocks__/                    # Mock data
    api-client.ts
  fixtures/                     # Test fixtures
    sample_data.py
```

#### Asset Organization Patterns

**Frontend Assets:**

```
/public/
  favicon.ico
  /assets/
    /images/
      logo.svg
      placeholder.png
    /fonts/
      custom-font.woff2
```

**Backend (No Static Assets):**
- API-only service (no static file serving)
- Documentation: Auto-generated by FastAPI at `/docs`

---

### Development Workflow Integration

#### Local Development Setup

**Local Development Notes (Updated 2025-12-30):**

- The following local containers are **NOT used** and should not be part of local dev assumptions:
  - `stockelper-postgres`
  - `stockelper-redis`
  - `stockelper-backtest-worker`
- **Chat (LLM) service** is built and run on **AWS EC2** using `stockelper-llm/cloud.docker-compose.yml`.
- **Backtesting** and **Portfolio** services run **locally** (initial phase) and persist results into a **remote PostgreSQL** schema `"stockelper-fe"`.
- Database credentials must be provided via environment variables (never committed in docs/repos).

**Development Server Commands:**

```bash
# Frontend (local dev)
cd stockelper-frontend
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:3000

# LLM Chat Service (production build on EC2)
# (Run this ON the EC2 instance)
cd stockelper-llm
docker compose -f cloud.docker-compose.yml up -d llm-server

# Backtesting Service (local - separate repo, to be created)
cd ../stockelper-backtesting
# run command will be defined in that repo (e.g., docker compose up -d)

# Portfolio Service (local - separate repo, to be created)
cd ../stockelper-portfolio
# run command will be defined in that repo (e.g., docker compose up -d)
```

**Hot Reload:**
- Frontend: Next.js Fast Refresh (automatic)
- Backend: Uvicorn `--reload` flag (automatic)
- Airflow: DAG file changes detected automatically

#### Build Process Structure

**Frontend Production Build:**

```bash
cd stockelper-frontend
npm run build                   # Next.js production build

Output:
  /.next/
    /static/                    # Static assets (hashed filenames)
    /server/                    # Server-side rendering code
    /standalone/                # Standalone deployment (Docker)
```

**Backend (No Build - Interpreted):**

```bash
cd stockelper-llm
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies
# Python is interpreted, no build step needed
```

**Containerization (Docker):**

**Frontend Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

**Backend Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "src.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

#### Deployment Structure

**Production Deployment (Docker Swarm / Kubernetes Example):**

#### 3.2 Gap Analysis

**Identified Gaps:**

| Gap ID | Description | Severity | Impact | Resolution |
|--------|-------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| **GAP-001** | **LangChain v1.0+ Compliance** | ✅ **VERIFIED** | Chat Interface (FR48-FR56) ready - no migration needed | **RESOLVED:** Verification (2025-12-29) confirmed v1.0+ StateGraph patterns already in use |

**Gap Details:**

**GAP-001: LangChain v1.0+ Compliance - ✅ VERIFIED (2025-12-29)**

- **Original Assumption:** Codebase uses LangChain v0.x patterns requiring migration
- **Verification Finding:** Codebase already uses LangChain v1.0+ compliant StateGraph patterns
- **Current State:** Production-ready with v1.0+ patterns
  - BaseAnalysisAgent: `StateGraph(SubState)` pattern
  - SupervisorAgent: `StateGraph(State)` pattern
  - All 5 analysis agents: Inherit BaseAnalysisAgent (automatically v1.0+ compliant)
  - Dependencies: `langchain>=1.0.0`, `langchain-classic>=1.0.0`
- **Target State:** ✅ ALREADY ACHIEVED - No migration required
- **Requirements Status:** FR48-FR56 (Chat Interface) NOT BLOCKED - ready for implementation
- **Verified Components:**
  - `/stockelper-llm/src/multi_agent/base/analysis_agent.py` - StateGraph v1.0+ compliant
  - `/stockelper-llm/src/multi_agent/supervisor_agent/agent.py` - StateGraph v1.0+ compliant
  - All 5 analysis agent files - v1.0+ compliant via inheritance
- **Revised Scope (Epic 0 Updated):**
  - ✅ Story 0.1: Verification complete (no migration needed)
  - 🆕 Story 0.2: Upgrade all agents to gpt-5.1 model
  - 🆕 Story 0.3: Validate message handling and content blocks
  - 🆕 Story 0.4: Comprehensive integration testing with StateGraph
  - ❌ Stories 0.2-0.7 (agent migration): REMOVED - not required
- **Estimated Effort:** 3-5 developer days (based on 4 agent files + testing)
- **Resolution:** Added to Architecture as **Phase 0 prerequisite task** - must complete before Epic & Story implementation begins

**Additional Observations (Not Gaps):**

| Observation ID | Description | Status | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **OBS-001** | **Sentiment Analysis Implementation** | ✅ **Positive Deviation** | PRD lists sentiment analysis as optional (future enhancement), but architecture includes it as implemented feature (`event.sentiment_score` in Neo4j schema). This is a **positive deviation** - team already built more than required. Recommend updating PRD to reflect reality. |
| **OBS-002** | **Deduplication Strategy Status** | ⚠️ **Needs Confirmation** | Architecture specifies hybrid embedding deduplication (0.6×dense + 0.4×sparse with 0.85 similarity threshold), but team meeting notes (20251215.md) mention "뉴스 중복 제거 로직 고려하기" (news deduplication logic consideration). Recommend confirming with team whether deduplication is implemented or still in planning. |
| **OBS-003** | **MongoDB Connection Issue** | ⚠️ **Operational** | Meeting notes (event-graph-sentiment-analysis.md) mention "MongoDB 연결이 되지 않아 경쟁사 관련 정보 확인하지 못했음" (MongoDB connection failed, couldn't verify competitor info). This is an **operational issue**, not architectural gap. Architecture correctly includes MongoDB for competitor/stock data - deployment/config needs troubleshooting. |

### 7. Implementation Handoff

**For Epic & Story Creation Teams:**

This architecture document provides everything needed to create implementation-ready epics and stories:

1. **Requirements Source:** `docs/prd.md` (103 FRs + 69 NFRs)
2. **Architectural Decisions:** Sections 3-4 of this document (13 decision categories)
3. **Implementation Patterns:** Section 5 (8 conflict categories with enforcement rules)
4. **Project Structure:** Section 6 (5 repositories with FR-to-file mapping)
5. **Validation Results:** Section 7 (this section - coherence, coverage, readiness)

**Critical Handoff Items:**

- **Phase 0 Prerequisite:** LangChain v1.0+ migration must complete **before** Epic implementation begins
- **Naming Patterns Enforcement:** All stories must reference Section 5 Implementation Patterns to prevent AI agent conflicts
- **Requirements Mapping:** Use Section 6 FR-to-file mappings to assign stories to correct repositories/files
- **Non-Functional Requirements:** Embed NFRs into story acceptance criteria (e.g., "Prediction API must respond <2s per NFR-P1")

**Quality Gates:**

Before marking any epic complete, verify:
1. ✅ Code follows Section 5 Implementation Patterns (naming, API, file org, errors)
2. ✅ Tests co-located with implementation (Section 6 structure)
3. ✅ API contracts match Section 3 decisions (REST, direct responses, HTTP codes)
4. ✅ NFRs validated (performance benchmarks, security scans, audit logs)

**Architecture Sign-Off:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR EPIC & STORY CREATION**

### Implementation Handoff

**For AI Agents:**
This architecture document is your complete guide for implementing Stockelper. Follow all decisions, patterns, and structures exactly as documented.

**First Implementation Priority:**
**Phase 0 Prerequisite** - Complete LangChain v1.0+ migration before Epic & Story implementation (estimated 3-5 developer days).

**Development Sequence:**

1. **Phase 0:** Execute LangChain v1.0+ migration task
   - Update dependencies: `langchain>=1.0.0`, `langchain-openai>=1.0.0`, `langgraph>=1.0.0`
   - Migrate 4 agent files: conversational_agent.py, prediction_agent.py, portfolio_agent.py, backtesting_agent.py
   - Update API patterns: ConversationChain → create_react_agent(), ConversationBufferMemory → ChatMessageHistory
   - Validate all tests pass with v1.0+ API patterns

2. **Phase 1:** Launch Epic & Story creation workflow
   - Use BMAD workflow: `/bmad:bmm:workflows:create-epics-stories`
   - Transform PRD requirements + Architecture decisions into implementation-ready stories
   - Organize stories by user value

3. **Phase 2:** Implement features following established patterns
   - Follow Section 5 Implementation Patterns for all code
   - Use Section 6 Project Structure for file placement
   - Embed NFRs into acceptance criteria (e.g., prediction <2s per NFR-P1)

4. **Phase 3:** Maintain consistency with documented rules
   - Code review against Implementation Patterns checklist
   - Validate API contracts match Section 3 decisions
